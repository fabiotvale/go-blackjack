Blackjack implementation in Golang

This project could use some third party library for part of the implementation, for instance to implement the deck, but for a sake of self-training I decided to write everything from scratch and self-encapsulated.

All code was made in a single file to make it easier for you to import it and test it online.

Some future improvements might include:
- Implement other basic features like double and split
- Handle some unknown errors
- Cover the code with unit tests
- Customize some initial options other than amount of players, for instance defining the wallet for each player
- Automate some other actions, for instance auto bid
- Make it realtime by using gRPC or websockets
- Implement a more sophisticated heuristic/AI for dealer's decisions

To run it locally:
> go run main.go -h

The official Go Playground's website (https://goplay.tools/) doesn't support interactive programs, but you can use the following one to run and test it online:
https://www.programiz.com/golang/online-compiler/ 
Just copy and paste the whole code there and click on 'Run'
